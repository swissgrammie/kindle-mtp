description: Review implementation against specification
---

Please review the current implementation against docs/spec.md:

1. **Coverage Check**: Which spec requirements are implemented vs pending?

2. **Deviation Check**: Does any implementation differ from spec? If so, is it documented?

3. **Gap Analysis**: What's the next most important thing to implement?

Present findings in a clear summary, then recommend next steps.
